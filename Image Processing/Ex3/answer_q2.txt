The size of the filter barely affects the blending. That's because if we 
look separately at the parts of the two images, at each step we always add
the layers of im1 and im2 on top of themselves respectively. So each part
follows the formula we saw in class that explains why when we add the
laplacian pyramid layers together we get the original image. That formula
works regardless of the size of the gaussian filter, which is why changing it
doesn't matter.
