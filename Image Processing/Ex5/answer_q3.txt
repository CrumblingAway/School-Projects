In both denoising and deblurring the validation error decreased the more we increased the amount of residual blocks. The lowering of the error is reflected in the quality of the images which also improves the more we increase the amount of residual blocks. In contrast when we look at SR the best result is achieved for 3 residual blocks (reflected in the quality of the images). The results in SR for 4 and 5 residual blocks are slightly worse than that of 3.
