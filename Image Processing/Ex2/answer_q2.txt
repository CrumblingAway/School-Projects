The difference between the functions is as stated in the documentation, that 
resize_vocoder fixes the phase shift unlike resize_spectrogram. When we apply
STFT on the spectrogram we change the frequencies in each window individually,
then when we apply ISTFT the windows are already changed and the phases of the
frequencies are shifted. The result is that in resize_spectrogram some of the
frequencies cancel out (or otherwise change the output), while resize_vocoder
takes the phase into account.
