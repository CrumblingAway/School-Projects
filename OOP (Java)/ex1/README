=============================
1) Book.java

The class defining the books, can be stored in the library class.

2) Patron.java

The class defining the patrons, can be registered in the library class.

3) Library.java

The class defining the library. Makes use of the Book and Patron class,
gives the option of borrowing or returning books and registering 
patrons.

=============================
=          Design           =
=============================
Book: mostly followed the course instructions. Added a field bookId(int)
and the methods setBookId() and getBookId(). The reason for that was 
to avoid having to go over the book list every time I wanted to return 
its ID (which is determined by its index in the list).

Patron: again, mostly followed the instructions. Similarly to Book, 
and for the same reason, I added the field patronId(int) and the 
appropriate set and get methods. Also I added the field 
borrowedBooks(int) and the appropriate set and get methods so I could 
keep track of every patron's amount of borrowed books.

Library: added the checkBook() method to check whether or not a book
already appears in the library. In terms of fields, I added bookId(int)
and patronId(int), both of which are set to 0 by default. They serve as 
counters for the ID of every new member/book, as in: the first 
book/patron will have the ID of 0, next 1, then 2 and so on.
The books and patrons themselves are stored in bookList[] and 
patronList[] respectively, with every book/patron being assigned the ID
of its index.

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
In the library class I chose to create two different arrays: one 
containing Book objects and the other Patron objects. Then upon 
adding an element to a list I chose to assign their ID based on their 
index in the list, since by doing that I avoid accidentally assigning 
the same ID to different books/patrons.
