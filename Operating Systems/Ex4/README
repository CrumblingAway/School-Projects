REMARKS:
In this exercise we implemented a library for managing virtual memory. 
The algorithm is based on hierarchical page tables, represented as a tree of tables.
The main part of the exercise was to create an algorithm for finding an appropriate frame for a given page.
We used recursion for traversing the tree and finding the relevant frame.
Then we stored the page in that frame. This process created the mapping between frames and pages.
