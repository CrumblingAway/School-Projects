REMARKS:

ANSWERS:

Quesiton 1:
One general use of user level threads are servers. Suppose we have multiple customrs simultaneously
(a server with many users), if we try to access data on the server then this action may take some time, 
but if we operate on multiple thread we can manage our time more efficiently and while one thread waits
to access the data, we can activate other threads so they aren't as affected by the downtime.

Question 2:
Advantages: 
* Processes are protected from each other, unlike kernel level threads that share resources.

Disatvangaes:
* Processes require the OS to intercommunicate, unlike kernel level threads that live in the same
address space and as such don't require system calls for communication.
* Processes have higher overhead than kernel level threads.

Question 3:
Interrupts involved during command execution:
* Keyboard interrupt by typing kill command in the shell. 
* The Operating system handles this interrupt by sending SIGKILL signal to the Shotwell process. 
* This signal terminates that process. 

Question 4:
Real time is the time in the real-world, for example 8:00. Virtual time is time relative to a specific process. 
Virtual time for a process starts when the process starts running, and continues only when the process runs.
For example, in moodle, after some time of inactivity, we get a message that says we have to reconnect. 
That event take place relative to moodle's process virtual time.
