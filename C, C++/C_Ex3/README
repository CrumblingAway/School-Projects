=======
infi.h:
=======
Header file containing the declerations of two functions, one for
calculating the integral and one for the derivative.

======
infi.c
======
File containing the actual implementation of the functions. Each
function receives arguments and checks that arguments are valid (using assert),
i.e. that the integral/derivative can be calculated using the arguments.

=========
libinfi.a
=========
Library containing only infi.c and infi.h.

===================
NumericalAnalyzer.c
===================
The program that contains the main function. It also contains a few
helper functions for parsing and input verification, as well as the
actual six functions our program is required to support.

In order to be able to use the funtions form infi.c, infi.h is #included
in NuemricalAnalyzer.c and in the linking stage of building the
executable file we link the library to NumericalAnalyzer.o.
The actual building instructions of the program are written in the makefile.
