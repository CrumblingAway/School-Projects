Description:

In this exercise we wrote a HashMap class and program that uses it to check if
an email is spam or not.

HashMap: most implementations are straightforward. To store the keys and values 
I use a dynammically allocated array of vectors of pairs. For the insert and erase 
methods I've written a helper function resize(), which uses its resize factor 
argument to either shrink or expand the HashMap storage.
The iterator is a const forward iterator. The iterator returned by begin() is 
the first encountered pair in the storage vectors going from 0 to capacity. The
iteration is done using the iterators of the vectors. The ++ operator simply
increments the vector iterator, and if we've reached the end of the vector we 
simply move on to the next vector.

SpamDetector: mostly straightforward parsing just like we've done in previous
exercises. The looking up of words from the mail in the database is done with two 
while loops. Doing so allows us to find phrases that are made up of more than one 
word.
