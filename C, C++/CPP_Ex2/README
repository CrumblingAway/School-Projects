Description:

I decided to create three classes that derive from Fractal, each representing 
the different fractal pattern. Fractal itself is not an abstract class, because 
it does not have any methods. Instead it declares an overload of the << operator, 
which contains the algorithm for drawing the fractal of a given dimension.

The patterns are stored individually in every derived class, as well as the size
of the pattern (for a 3x3 pattern the size is 3, not 9) and the dimension of the 
fractal.

In Fractal I also implemented the static method fractalFactory, which is responsible
for creating the appropriate fractal.

In addition I also implemented the rule of five in the Fractal class.
